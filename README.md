# Ethical Web Scraping Examples

This repository provides succinct, educational examples of how to build web scrapers in Python responsibly. It is designed for developers, data scientists, and researchers who want to learn how to scrape ethically and sustainably. 

## What You'll Learn

Each example demonstrates a core principle of ethical scraping:

1. Respect `robots.txt` — Check permissions before scraping.  
2. Respect infrastructure — Implement rate limits, backoff, and avoid hammering servers.  
3. Respect identity — Rotate `User-Agent`s responsibly, without impersonation or cloaking.  
4. Respect data subjects — Avoid collecting sensitive or personal data without lawful basis.  
5. Efficient workflows — Cache responses and analyze locally to minimize requests.  
6. Reduce server strain — Use parallelization carefully with throttling and per-host limits.
